## What is it?
Graph algorithms consist of measuring or finding something on a graph using an algorithm. In our case, we are looking to find the shortest path on a given graph.
In addition, we generate a graph based on coordinates of cities calculating their Euclidean distance.

## What's the point?
The aim of this study is to analyse the four main algorithms to find the shortest path in a graph.
